                    <p>
                        Eating a healthy diet has many health benefits including maintaining optimal weight, 
                        preventing disease, and boosting your mood.
                        <br><br>
                        In general, healthy eating starts with making good food choices. A healthy diet includes 
                        nutrient-dense foods from all major food groups including lean proteins, whole grains, 
                        and healthful fats, and eliminating or significantly reducing processed foods.
                    </p>

                    Maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce the risk of many chronic health issues. Being 
                    overweight or obese, however, significantly increases your chances of serious diseases, including:

                        <li>Heart disease</li>
                        <li>Some cancers</li>
                        <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
                        <li>Osteoporosis</li>
                    </ul>

                    Many healthy foods including vegetables, fruits, and beans are lower in calories and loaded with 
                    healthful nutrients. Furthermore, they tend to be higher in dietary fiber. Dietary fiber plays 
                    an important role in weight management. It helps regulate hunger by making you feel full longer, 
                    and it also helps with elimination.

                        <li><strong>Plan your healthy meals:</strong> This reduces your chances of making poor choices or binge eating.</li>
                        <li><strong>Know how much you eat:</strong> It is very easy to consume more calories than you realize.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vary your vegetables:</strong> By eating different vegetables, you may feel more satisfied.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use herbs and spices:</strong> These ingredients add flavor without significantly increasing calories.</li>
                        <li><strong>Read the nutrition facts labels: Know precisely what's in the foods you eat.</strong></li>

                    Research suggests that there may be a close relationship between diet and mood. In 2016, 
                    researchers found that diets with a high glycemic load may trigger increased symptoms of 
                    fatigue and depression.
                    <br><br>
                    Foods with a high glycemic load include refined carbohydrates or simple sugars. Examples 
                    of this type of food include sugary drinks, white breads, biscuits, cookies, and cakes. 
                    Conversely, vegetables, whole fruit, whole grains and lean proteins have a lower glycemic load.
                    <br>

                    <br><h3 id = "HeartHealth">Heart Health</h3>

                    According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading 
                    cause of death for adults in the United States. The American Heart Association reports that 
                    nearly half of all adults in the United States live with some form of heart disease.
                    <br><br>
                    Healthy eating and increased physical activity can help prevent high blood pressure or premature 
                    heart disease. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is recommended as a dietary 
                    approach to reduce high blood pressure. This diet includes:

                    <br><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.</li>
                        <li>Choosing fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils.</li>
                        <li>Limiting saturated and trans fat intake, such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products.</li>
                        <li>Limiting food or drinks that contain added sugar.</li>
                        <li>Restricting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day and increasing your intake of 
                            calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Note that 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day is ideal.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Additional recommendations for heart health include choosing foods high in fiber. Dietary fiber may 
                    improve blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk for heart disease and other chronic diseases.

                    Eating foods that contain antioxidants can help reduce your risk of developing some cancers. Antioxidants 
                    help protect our bodies cells from damage by removing free radicals, which can cause disease.
                    <br><br>
                    Fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes contain many phytochemicals, which act as antioxidants.

                    Research suggests that a healthy diet might protect against cognitive decline. In one particular 
                    study, vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin E, omega fatty acids, fish, polyphenols, and flavonoids were 
                    all considered beneficial. The healthy eating suggestions previously recommended in this article 
                    also impart improved memory benefits.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Eat more vegetables</li>

                        <li>Eat whole grains</li>
                        <li>Include nuts and seeds</li>
                        <li>Choose good fats</li>
