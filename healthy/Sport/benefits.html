                A healthy lifestyle can help you thrive throughout your life.

                prepare healthy meals. However, your efforts will pay off

                    We have all heard it many times before - regular exercise is good for you, and it can help you lose weight. 
                    But if you are like many Americans, you are busy, you have a sedentary job, and you haven't yet changed your 
                    exercise habits. The good news is that it's never too late to start. You can start slowly, and find ways to fit 
                    more physical activity into your life. To get the most benefit, you should try to get the recommended amount 
                    of exercise for your age. If you can do it, the payoff is that you will feel better, help prevent or control 
                    many diseases, and likely even live longer.

                              Exercise has been shown to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress.
                              It produces changes in the parts of the brain that regulate stress and anxiety. It can also increase brain 
                              sensitivity for the hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of depression.
                              Additionally, exercise can increase the production of endorphins, which are known to help produce positive 
                              feelings and reduce the perception of pain.
                              <br><br>
                              Furthermore, exercise has been shown to reduce stress and improve symptoms of anxiety. Interestingly, it 
                              doesn’t matter how intense your workout is. It seems that your mood can benefit from exercise no matter the 
                              intensity of the physical activity. In fact, a study in 24 women who had been diagnosed with depression showed 
                              hat exercise of any intensity significantly decreased feelings of depression.The effects of exercise on mood 
                              are so powerful that choosing to exercise (or not) even makes a difference over short periods. One review of 
                              19 studies found that active people who stopped exercising regularly experienced significant increases in 
                              symptoms of depression and anxiety, even after only a few weeks.

                                Some studies have shown that inactivity is a major factor in weight gain and obesity. To understand the effect 
                                of exercise on weight reduction, it is important to understand the relationship between exercise and energy 
                                expenditure.
                                <br><br>
                                Your body spends energy in three ways:
                                <br><br>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>digesting food</li>
                                    <li>exercising</li>
                                    <li>maintaining body functions like your heartbeat and breathing</li>
                                </ul>

                                While dieting, a reduced calorie intake will lower your metabolic rate, which can delay weight loss. On the 
                                contrary, regular exercise has been shown to increase your metabolic rate, which can burn more calories to 
                                help you lose weight. Additionally, studies have shown that combining aerobic exercise with resistance 
                                training can maximize fat loss and muscle mass maintenance, which is essential for keeping the weight off.

                                    Exercise plays a vital role in building and maintaining strong muscles and bones. Activities like 
                                    weightlifting can stimulate muscle building when paired with adequate protein intake. This is because 
                                    exercise helps release hormones that promote the ability of your muscles to absorb amino acids. 
                                    This helps them grow and reduces their breakdown. As people age, they tend to lose muscle mass and 
                                    function, which can lead to an increased risk of injury. Practicing regular physical activity is 
                                    essential to reducing muscle loss and maintaining strength as you age.

                                    Also, exercise helps build bone density when you’re younger, in addition to helping prevent osteoporosis 
                                    later in life. Interestingly, some research suggests that high impact exercise, such as gymnastics or 
                                    running, or odd impact sports, such as soccer and basketball, may help promote a higher bone density 
                                    than non-impact sports like swimming and cycling.

                                        Exercise can be a real energy booster for many people, including those with various medical conditions.
                                        One older study found that 6 weeks of regular exercise reduced feelings of fatigue for 36 people who had 
                                        reported persistent fatigue. Furthermore, exercise can significantly increase energy levels for people 
                                        with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and other serious illnesses.

                                        In fact, exercise seems to be more effective at combating CFS than other treatments, including passive 
                                        therapies like relaxation and stretching or no treatment at all. Additionally, exercise has been shown 
                                        to increase energy levels in people with other conditions like cancer.

                                            Regular exercise can help you relax and sleep better. With regard to sleep quality, the energy 
                                            depletion that occurs during exercise stimulates recuperative processes during sleep. Moreover, 
                                            the increase in body temperature that occurs during exercise is thought to improve sleep quality 
                                            by helping it drop during sleep. Many studies on the effects of exercise on sleep have reached 
                                            similar conclusions.
                                            <br><br>
                                            One review of six studies found that participating in an exercise training program helped improve 
                                            self-reported sleep quality and reduced sleep latency, which is the amount of time it takes to 
                                            fall asleep. Another older study showed that 16 weeks of physical activity improved sleep quality 
                                            and helped 17 people with insomnia sleep longer and more deeply than the control group. It also 
                                            helped them feel more energized during the day.

                                            What’s more, engaging in regular exercise seems to be beneficial for older adults, who are often 
                                            affected by sleep disorders. You can be flexible with the kind of exercise you choose. It appears 
                                            that either aerobic exercise alone or aerobic exercise combined with resistance training can both 
                                            improve sleep quality.
