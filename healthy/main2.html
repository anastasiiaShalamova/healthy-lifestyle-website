              A healthy lifestyle can help you thrive throughout your life. 
              Making healthy choices isn't always easy. It can be 
              hard to find the time and energy to exercise regularly or 
              prepare healthy meals. However, your efforts will pay off 
              in many ways, and for the rest of your life.

                  <p class = "lead"><br>
                      Ask 50 people to define what a “healthy lifestyle” is, and you’ll likely get 50 
                      different answers. That’s because there’s no one way to be healthy. A healthy 
                      lifestyle simply means doing things that make you happy and feel good. 
                      <br><br>
                      For one person, that may mean walking a mile five times a week, eating fast food 
                      once a week, and spending virtual or in-person time with loved ones every other day. 
                      For someone else, a healthy lifestyle may be training and running two marathons 
                      a year, following a keto diet, and never having a sip of alcohol. 
                      <br><br>
                      Neither of these is better than the other. Both are perfect for that person. You 
                      get to decide what your healthy lifestyle looks like.

                              including those that may run in your family.
                              <br><br>
                              For example, in a recent study, adults who followed a standard American diet 
                              (rich in fruits and vegetables) for 8 weeks had a reduced risk of cardiovascular 
                              disease.
                              <br><br>
                              In another 2020 study, researchers found that every 66-gram 
                              increase in daily fruit and vegetable intake was associated with a 25 percent 
                              lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
                              <br><br>
                              Swapping out some refined grains for whole grains also reduces the risk of 
                              disease. In an observational study of almost 200,000 adults, those who ate 
                              the most whole grains had a 29 percent lower rate of type 2 diabetes than 
                              those who ate the least.
                              <br><br>
                              And a review of 45 studies concluded that eating 90 grams (or three 30-gram 
                              servings) of whole grains daily reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease 
                              by 22 percent, coronary heart disease by 19 percent, and cancer by 15 percent.
                              <br><br>
                              In terms of exercise, as little as 11 minutes a day may add years to your life. 
                              In a 2020 study, researchers tracked more than 44,000 adults. Those who got 11 
                              minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day had a lower risk of 
                              death compared to those who only exercised at that intensity for 2 minutes. 
                              This comparison held true even if people sat for 8.5 hours every day.</p>

                                Some examples of these foods are cheese puffs, packaged dessert cakes, 
                                chicken nuggets, and sweetened breakfast cereals. More than 70 percent of 
                                foods in U.S. supermarkets are ultra-processed.

                              The making of ultra-processed foods contributes to greenhouse gas emissions,

                              gas emissions would be the equivalent of taking four to six million cars off

                      A healthy lifestyle can not only help you feel better, but it can also reduce the 
                      risk of some diseases, lengthen your lifespan, save you money, and benefit the environment.
                      <br><br>
                      Your version of a healthy lifestyle is whatever you define it to be. There’s nothing you 
                      must or must not do in order to be healthy. Identify what makes you feel good and what 
                      brings you the greatest happiness. Then, start small when you make changes. You’re more 
                      likely to see success this way, and small successes will snowball into bigger benefits.
                      <br><br>
                      Lastly, if you want help with making any lifestyle changes, talk to your doctor. If they 
                      can’t directly help you, they may recommend other professionals, like registered dietitians 
                      or therapists.
